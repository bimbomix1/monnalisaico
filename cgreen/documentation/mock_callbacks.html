        <p>
            When testing you want certainty above all else.
            Random events destroy confidence in your test suite
            and force needless extra runs "to be sure".
            A good test places the subject under test into a
            tightly controlled environment.
            A test chamber if you like.
            This makes the tests fast, repeatable and reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a test chamber for testing code, we have
            to control any outgoing calls from the code under test.
            We won't believe our test failure if our code is making
            calls to the internet for example.
            The internet can fail all by itself.
            Not only do we not have total control, but it means
            we have to get dependent components
            working before we can test the higher level code.
            This makes it difficult to code top down.
        </p>
        <p>
            The solution to this dilemma is to write stub code for
            the components whilst the higher level code is written.
            This pollutes the code base with temporary code, and
            the test isolation disappears when the system is eventually
            fleshed out.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ideal is to have minimal stubs written for each
            individual test.
            Cgreen encourages this approach by making such tests
            easier to write.

<h2>The problem with streams</h2>
</a>
</p>
            <p>
                How do we test this code...?
<pre>
char *read_paragraph(<strong>int (*read)(void *), void *stream</strong>) {
    int buffer_size = 0, length = 0;
    char *buffer = NULL;
    int ch;
    while (<strong>(ch = (*read)(stream)) != EOF</strong>) {
        if (++length &gt; buffer_size) {
            buffer_size += 100;
            buffer = realloc(buffer, buffer_size + 1);
        }
        if ((buffer[length] = ch) == '\n') {
            break;
        }
    }
    return buffer;
}
</pre>
                This is a fairly generic stream filter that turns
                the incoming characters into C string paragraphs.
                Each call creates one paragraph, returning a pointer
                to it or returning <span class="new_code">NULL</span> if there is no paragraph.
                The paragraph has memory allocated to it and the
                stream is advanced ready for the next call.
                That's quite a bit of functionality, and there
                are plenty of nasty boundary conditions.
                I really want this code tested before I deploy it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem is the stream dependency.
                We could use a real stream, but that will cause all sorts of
                headaches.
                It makes the test of our paragraph formatter dependent
                on a working stream.
                It means we have to write the stream first, bottom up coding
                rather than top down.
                It means we will have to simulate stream failures - not easy.
                It will also mean setting up external resources.
                This is more work, will run slower, and could lead
                to spurious test failures.
            </p>
            <p>
                By contrast we could write a simulation of the stream for each
                test, called a "server stub".
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, when the stream is empty nothing should happen.
                We hopefully get <span class="new_code">NULL</span> from <span class="new_code">read_paragraph</span>
                when the stream is exhausted.
                That is, it just returns a steady stream of <span class="new_code">EOF</span>s.
<pre>
static <strong>int empty_stream(void *stream) {
    return EOF;
}</strong>

static void reading_lines_from_empty_stream_gives_null() {
    assert_equal(read_paragraph(<strong>&amp;empty_stream, NULL</strong>), NULL);
}

TestSuite *stream_tests() {
    TestSuite *suite = create_test_suite();
    add_test(suite, reading_lines_from_empty_stream_gives_null);
    return suite;
}
</pre>
                Our simulation is easy here, because our fake stream returns only
                one value.
                Things are harder when the function result changes from
                call to call as a real stream would.
                Simulating this would mean messing around with static variables and counters
                that are reset for each test.
                And of course, we will be writing quite a few stubs.
                Often a different one for each test.
                That's a lot of clutter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cgreen handles this clutter for us
                by letting us write a single programmable function
                for all our tests.
            </p>
        
        <p>
<a class="target" name="stubs">
<h2>Record and playback</h2>
</a>
</p>
            <p>
                We can redo our example by creating a <span class="new_code">stub_stream()</span> function
                (any name will do)...
<pre>
<strong>static int stub_stream(void *stream) {
    return (int)mock();
}</strong>
</pre>
                Hardly longer that our trivial server stub above,
                it is just a macro to generate a return value,
                but we can reuse this in test after test.
            </p>
            <p>
                For our simple example above we just tell it to always return
                <span class="new_code">EOF</span>...
<pre>
static int stub_stream(void *stream) {
    return (int)mock();
}

static void reading_lines_from_empty_stream_gives_null() {
    <strong>always_return(stub_stream, EOF);</strong>
    assert_equal(read_paragraph(&amp;stub_stream, NULL), NULL);
}
</pre>
                The <span class="new_code">always_return()</span> macro takes as arguments the
                function name and the return value.
                We have told <span class="new_code">stub_stream()</span> to always return
                <span class="new_code">EOF</span> when called.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's see if our production code actually works...
<pre class="shell">
Running "main"...
Completed "main": 1 pass, 0 failures, 0 exceptions.
</pre>
                So far, so good.
                On to the next test.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we want to test a one character line, we have to send
                the terminating <span class="new_code">EOF</span> or <span class="new_code">"\n"</span>
                as well as the single character.
                Otherwise our code will loop forever, giving an infinite
                line of that character.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is how we can do this...
<pre>
static void one_character_stream_gives_one_character_line() {<strong>
    will_return(stub_stream, 'a');
    will_return(stub_stream, EOF);</strong>
    char *line = read_paragraph(&amp;stub_stream, NULL);<strong>
    assert_string_equal(line, "a");</strong>
    free(line);
}
</pre>
                Unlike the <span class="new_code">always_return()</span> instruction, <span class="new_code">will_return()</span>
                sets just a single return value.
                It acts like a record and playback model.
                Successive instructions map out the return sequence that will be
                given back once the test proper starts.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll add this test to the suite and run it...
<pre class="shell">
Running "main"...
Failure!: stream_tests -&gt; one_character_stream_gives_one_character_line -&gt;
        [] should match [a] at [stream_test.c] line [19]
Completed "main": 1 pass, 1 failure, 0 exceptions.
</pre>
                Oops. Our code under test doesn't work.
                Already we need a fix...
<pre>
char *read_paragraph(int (*read)(void *), void *stream) {
    int buffer_size = 0, length = 0;
    char *buffer = NULL;
    int ch;
    while ((ch = (*read)(stream)) != EOF) {
        if (++length &gt; buffer_size) {
            buffer_size += 100;
            buffer = realloc(buffer, buffer_size + 1);
        }
        if ((buffer[<strong>length - 1</strong>] = ch) == '\n') {
            break;
        }
    }
    return buffer;
}
</pre>
                After which everything is fine...
<pre class="shell">
Running "main"...
Completed "main": 2 passes, 0 failures, 0 exceptions.
</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                How do the Cgreen stubs work?
                The <span class="new_code">will_return()</span> calls build up a static list of
                return values which are cleared between tests.
                The <span class="new_code">mock()</span> macro captures the
                <span class="new_code">__func__</span> property.
                It uses these to look up entries in the return list, and also to
                generate more helpful messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can crank out our tests quite quickly now...
<pre>
static void one_word_stream_gives_one_word_line() {<strong>
    will_return(stub_stream, 't');
    will_return(stub_stream, 'h');
    will_return(stub_stream, 'e');</strong>
    always_return(stub_stream, EOF);
    assert_string_equal(read_paragraph(&amp;stub_stream, NULL), <strong>"the"</strong>);
}
</pre>
                I've been a bit naughty.
                As each test runs in it's own process, I haven't bothered
                to free the pointers to the paragraphs.
                I've just let the operating system do it.
                Purists may want to add the extra clean up code.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also used <span class="new_code">always_return()</span> for the last instruction.
                Withou this, if the stub is given an instruction is does
                not expect, it will throw a test failure.
                This is overly restrictive, as our <span class="new_code">read_paragraph()</span>
                function could quite legitimately call the stream after it had
                run off of the end.
                OK, that would be odd behaviour, but that's not what we are testing here.
                If we were, it would be placed in a test of it's own.
                The <span class="new_code">always_return()</span> call tells <em>Cgreen</em> to keep
                going after the first three letters, allowing extra calls.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we build more tests, they start to look like a specification
                of the behaviour...
<pre>
static void drops_line_ending_from_word_and_stops() {<strong>
    will_return(stub_stream, 't');
    will_return(stub_stream, 'h');
    will_return(stub_stream, 'e');
    will_return(stub_stream, '\n');</strong>
    assert_string_equal(read_paragraph(&amp;stub_stream, NULL), <strong>"the"</strong>);
}
</pre>
                ...and just for luck...
<pre>
static void single_line_ending_gives_empty_line() {<strong>
    will_return(stub_stream, '\n');</strong>
    assert_string_equal(read_paragraph(&amp;stub_stream, NULL), <strong>""</strong>);
}
</pre>
                This time we musn't use <span class="new_code">always_return()</span>.
                We want to leave the stream where it is, ready for the next
                call to <span class="new_code">read_paragraph()</span>.
                If we call the stream beyond the line ending, we want to fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out that we are failing anyway...
<pre class="shell">
Running "main"...
Failure!: stream_tests -&gt; drops_line_ending_from_word_and_stops -&gt; [the

Completed "main": 3 passes, 2 failures, 0 exceptions.
</pre>
                Clearly we are passing through the line ending.
                Another fix later...
<pre>
char *read_paragraph(int (*read)(void *), void *stream) {
    int buffer_size = 0, length = 0;
    char *buffer = NULL;
    int ch;

        if (++length &gt; buffer_size) {

            break;
        }
        buffer[length] = '\0';
    }
    return buffer;

                And we are passing again...
<pre class="shell">

            </p>
            <p>
                There are no limits to the number of stubbed methods within a
                test, only that two stubs cannot have the same name.
                So this will cause problems...
<pre>
static int stub_stream(void *stream) {
    return (int)mock();
}
<strong>
static void bad_test() {
    will_return(stub_stream, 'a');
    do_stuff(&amp;stub_stream, &amp;stub_stream);
}</strong>
</pre>
                It will be necessary to have two stubs to make this test behave...
<pre>
static int first_stream(void *stream) {
    return (int)mock();
}

static int second_stream(void *stream) {
    return (int)mock();
}
<strong>
static void good_test() {
    will_return(first_stream, 'a');
    will_return(second_stream, 'a');
    do_stuff(&amp;first_stream, &amp;second_stream);
}</strong>
</pre>
                We now have a way of writing fast, clear tests with no
                external dependencies.
                The information flow is still one way though, from stub to the
                code under test.
                When our code calls complex procedures, we won't want to pick
                apart the effects to infer what happened.
                That's too much like detective work.
                And why should we?
                We just want to know that we dispatched the correct information
                down the line.
            </p>
            <p>
                Things get more interesting when we thing of
                the traffic going the other way, from code to stub.
                This gets us into the same territory as mock objects.
            </p>
        
        <p>
<a class="target" name="mocks">
<h2>Setting expectations on mock functions</h2>
</a>
</p>
            <p>
                To swap the traffic flow, we'll look at an outgoing example instead.
                Here is the prewritten production code...
<pre>
void by_paragraph(int (*read)(void *), void *in, <strong>void (*write)(void *, char *), void *out</strong>) {
    while (1) {
        char *line = read_paragraph(read, in);
        if (line == NULL) {
            return;
        }
        <strong>(*write)(out, line);</strong>
        free(line);
    }
}
</pre>
                This is the start of a formatter utility.
                Later filters will probably break the paragaphs up into justified text,
                but right now that is all abstracted behind the
                <span class="new_code">void write(void *, char *)</span> interface.
                Our current interests are: does it loop through the paragraphs, and does
                it crash?
            </p>
            <p>
                We could test correct paragraph formation by writing a stub
                that collects the paragraphs into a <span class="new_code">struct</span>.
                We could then pick apart that <span class="new_code">struct</span> and test
                each piece with assertions.
                This approach is extremely clumsy in C.
                The language is just not suited to building and tearing down
                complex edifices, never mind navigating them with assertions.
                We would badly clutter our tests.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead we'll test the output as soon as possible, right in
                the called function...
<pre>
...<strong>
void expect_one_letter_paragraph(char *paragraph, void *stream) {
    assert_string_equal(paragraph, "a", NULL);
}</strong>

void one_character_is_made_into_a_one_letter_paragraph() {
    by_paragraph(
            <strong>&amp;one_character_stream</strong>,
            NULL,
            <strong>&amp;expect_one_letter_paragraph</strong>,
            NULL);
}
...

                By placing the assertions into the mocked function, we
                keep the tests minimal.
                The catch with this method is that we are back to writing
                individual functions for each test.
                We have the same problem as we had with hand coded stubs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, <em>Cgreen</em> has a way to automate this.
                Here is the rewritten test...
<pre>
static int reader(void *stream) {
    return (int)mock(<strong>stream</strong>);
}

static void writer(void *stream, char *paragraph) {
    <strong>mock(stream, paragraph);</strong>
}

void one_character_is_made_into_a_one_letter_paragraph() {<strong>
    will_return(reader, 'a');
    always_return(reader, EOF);
    expect(writer, want_string(paragraph, "a"));</strong>
    by_paragraph(<strong>&amp;reader</strong>, NULL, <strong>&amp;writer</strong>, NULL);
}
</pre>
                Where are the assertions?
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike our earlier stub, <span class="new_code">reader()</span> can now check it's
                parameters.
                In object oriented circles, an object that checks it's
                parameters as well as simulating behaviour is called a
                mock object.
                By analogy <span class="new_code">reader()</span> is a mock function, or
                mock callback.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using the <span class="new_code">expect</span> macro, we have stated that
                <span class="new_code">writer()</span> will be called just once.
                That call must have the string <span class="new_code">"a"</span> for the
                paragraph parameter.
                If this parameter does not match, the mock function will
                issue a failure straight to the test suite.
                This is what saves us writing a lot of assertions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the full list of instructions that can be sent to the mocks...
                <table>
                    <tr>
<th>Macro</th><th>Parameters</th>
</tr>
                    <tr>
<td><span class="new_code">will_return(function, result)</span></td><td>Returns result once only, but successive calls will be replayed in order. Generates a failure when called too many times.</td>
</tr>
                    <tr>
<td><span class="new_code">always_return(function, result)</span></td><td>Returns result repeatedly.</td>
</tr>
                    <tr>
<td><span class="new_code">expect(function, arguments...)</span></td><td>Sets up an expectation on each argument. If there is a mismatch, or a call is made without an expectation, a failure is generated.</td>
</tr>
                    <tr>
<td><span class="new_code">always_expect(function, arguments...)</span></td><td>Must receive exactly these arguments from now on.</td>
</tr>
                    <tr>
<td><span class="new_code">expect_never(function)</span></td><td>This function must not be called or a failure is generated.</td>
</tr>
                    <tr>
<td><span class="new_code">will_respond(function, result, arguments...)</span></td><td>Combines <span class="new_code">will_return()</span> and <span class="new_code">expect()</span>.</td>
</tr>
                    <tr>
<td><span class="new_code">always_respond(function, result, arguments...)</span></td><td>Combines <span class="new_code">always_return()</span> and <span class="new_code">always_expect()</span>.</td>
</tr>
                </table>
                The <span class="new_code">expect_never()</span> macro is slightly different.
                It's only task is to confirm that a method was never run.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="new_code">will_respond()</span> macro combines the <span class="new_code">will_return()</span>
                and the <span class="new_code">expect()</span> calls into one call, as does <span class="new_code">always_respond</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each parameter can be tested with a constraint.
                Two constraints are available:
                <span class="new_code">want(parameter, expected)</span> for integers and pointers, and
                <span class="new_code">want_string(parameter, expected)</span> does a string comparison.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's about time we actually ran our test...
<pre class="shell">
Running "main"...
Completed "main": 6 passes, 0 failures, 0 exceptions.
</pre>
                Confident that a single character works, we can further
                specify the behaviour.
                Firstly an input sequence...
<pre>
static void no_line_endings_makes_one_paragraph() {
    will_return(reader, 'a');
    will_return(reader, ' ');
    will_return(reader, 'b');
    will_return(reader, ' ');
    will_return(reader, 'c');
    always_return(reader, EOF);<strong>
    expect(writer, want_string(paragraph, "a b c"));</strong>
    by_paragraph(&amp;reader, NULL, &amp;writer, NULL);
}
</pre>
                A more intelligent programmer than me would place all
                these calls in a loop.
                Next, checking an output sequence...
<pre>
static void line_endings_generate_separate_paragraphs() {
    will_return(reader, 'a');
    will_return(reader, '\n');
    will_return(reader, 'b');
    will_return(reader, '\n');
    will_return(reader, 'c');
    always_return(reader, EOF);<strong>
    expect(writer, want_string(paragraph, "a"));
    expect(writer, want_string(paragraph, "b"));
    expect(writer, want_string(paragraph, "c"));</strong>
    by_paragraph(&amp;reader, NULL, &amp;writer, NULL);
}
</pre>
                Like the <span class="new_code">will_return()</span> stubs above, the
                <span class="new_code">expect()</span> calls follow a record and playback model.
                Each one tests a successive call.
                This sequence confirms that we get <span class="new_code">"a"</span>,
                <span class="new_code">"b"</span> and <span class="new_code">"c"</span> in
                order.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we'll make sure the correct stream pointers are passed to
                the correct functions.
                This is a more realistic parameter check...
<pre>
static void resources_are_paired_with_the_functions() {
    will_respond(reader, 'a', want(stream, 1));
    always_respond(reader, EOF, want(stream, 1));
    expect(writer, want(stream, 2));
    by_paragraph(&amp;reader, (void *)1, &amp;writer, (void *)2);
}
</pre>
                And finally we'll specify that the writer is not called if
                there is no paragraph.
<pre>
static void empty_paragraphs_are_ignored() {
    will_return(reader, '\n');
    always_return(reader, EOF);<strong>
    expect_never(writer);</strong>
    by_paragraph(&amp;reader, NULL, &amp;writer, NULL);
}
</pre>
                This last test is our undoing...
<pre class="shell">
Running "main"...
Failure!: stream_tests -&gt; empty_paragraphs_are_ignored -&gt;
        Unexpected call to function [writer] at [stream_test.c] line [96]
Completed "main": 14 passes, 1 failure, 0 exceptions.
</pre>
                Obviously blank lines are still being dispatched to the
                <span class="new_code">writer()</span>.
                Once this is pointed out, the fix is obvious...
<pre>
void by_paragraph(int (*read)(void *), void *in, void (*write)(void *, char *), void *out) {
    while (1) {
        char *line = read_paragraph(read, in);
        if (<strong>(line == NULL) || (strlen(line) == 0)</strong>) {
            return;
        }
        (*write)(out, line);
        free(line);
    }
}
</pre>
                Tests with <span class="new_code">expect_never()</span> can be very effective
                at uncovering subtle bugs.
<pre class="shell">
Running "main"...
Completed "main": 14 passes, 0 failures, 0 exceptions.
</pre>
                All done.
            </p>
